# Exercise: Iowa Housing – Predicting Sale Price

## Instructions
Load the Iowa housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Select the target variable (SalePrice) for prediction.

Choose a subset of predictive features to create a DataFrame X.

Specify and fit a Decision Tree Regressor using X and y.

Make predictions on the training data and inspect the results.

Review the top predictions versus actual sale prices.

This exercise demonstrates the full machine learning workflow: define → fit → predict → evaluate.
