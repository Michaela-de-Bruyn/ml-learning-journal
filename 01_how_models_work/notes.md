# Lesson 1: How Models Work

## Objective
Understand how machine learning models learn from data and how Decision Trees work as a basic ML model.

## Key Concepts
- Machine Learning = finding patterns in data to make predictions for new data.
- Decision Tree = a simple model that splits data into categories to predict an outcome.
- Training data = the dataset used to teach the model patterns.
- Fitting / Training = the process of using data to determine model splits and leaf values.
- Leaf = the final node in a decision tree where a prediction is made.
- Depth = number of splits in the tree; deeper trees capture more factors but may overfit.

## Real-World Example
- Scenario: Predicting house prices for real estate investment.
- Intuition-based approach is replaced with data-driven predictions.
- Simple Decision Tree splits houses into two categories and predicts prices based on historical averages.

## Reflection
- Decision Trees are easy to understand and a foundation for more complex models.
- Depth and features considered determine prediction accuracy.
- Next step: Explore actual data and build a simple Decision Tree in Python.
