# Lesson 1: How Models Work

## Objective
Understand how machine learning models learn from data and how Decision Trees work as a basic ML model.

## Key Concepts
- **Machine Learning**: Finding patterns in data to make predictions for new data.
- **Decision Tree**: A simple model that splits data into categories to predict an outcome.
- **Training Data**: The dataset used to teach the model patterns.
- **Fitting / Training**: The process of using data to determine model splits and leaf values.
- **Leaf**: The final node in a decision tree where a prediction is made.
- **Depth**: Number of splits in the tree; deeper trees capture more factors but may overfit.

## Real-World Example
- Scenario: Predicting house prices for real estate investment.
- Intuition-based approach is replaced with data-driven predictions.
- Simple Decision Tree splits houses into two categories and predicts prices based on historical averages.

## Decision Tree Examples

### Simple Tree

*Figure 1: A very basic decision tree splitting houses into two categories.*

### Improving the Simple Tree

*Figure 2: A slightly deeper tree capturing additional factors like the number of bedrooms.*

### Decision Tree In-Depth

## Reflection
- Decision Trees are easy to understand and form the foundation for more complex models.
- Tree depth and number of features affect prediction accuracy.
- Next step: Explore actual data and build a simple Decision Tree in Python.
