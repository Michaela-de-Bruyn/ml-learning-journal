## 1️⃣ Import Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd
```
# Explanation:

pandas is the primary Python library for working with structured data (CSV files, Excel sheets, SQL tables).
We import it as pd (common shorthand) to make the code easier to read.
Pandas provides the DataFrame, which is like a table in Excel or a SQL database — the main structure used in data science.
